  Creating new <dfn>MIDI track(s)</dfn> can be done using the <kbd class="menu">Session &gt;
  Add Track/Bus</kbd> menu. In the <a href="@@adding-tracks-busses-and-vcas">Add
  Track/Bus dialog</a>, <kbd class="menu">MIDI Tracks</kbd> must be picked from
  the left panel.
</p>

<p>
  A track template can be used, by selecting it in the <em>Configuration</em> drop
  down menu.
</p>

<p>
  One singularity of the MIDI track creation in the ability to select right at
  creation time the instrument that will be used in the track. The instrument in
  this context is any plugin that will generate audio in response to receiving MIDI.
